TODO list:

  * Look inside the archive to determine the file type

  * (*HELP*) I18N stuff without GNOME (I want something like GTK+ has, no
    gettext sources in intl/, use gettext if detected in system) (*HELP*)

  * Add preferences window
  * Add a "recently used files" section in file menu
  * Add an archive-info window, showing info and statistics
  * Implement outgoing drops
  * Implement drag&drop on the multiple file selection widget (GtkMyFilesel)
  * Add support for more archive programs (maybe deb/rpm?)
  * User-configurable archivers
  * Implement full slpv6 support (when slpv6 is out)
  * Add icons to toolbar (if you want to draw some icons, contact me)
  * Enhance Gnome-Session-Manager stuff (?)
  * Use Gnome's MDI functions when compiling with Gnome (uhh..)

  * (*HELP*) Progressbar should also 'progress' when the program's waiting for
    tar/zip/etc to finish. the code is commented out in gladesrc.c, it does
	not work. (*HELP*)
